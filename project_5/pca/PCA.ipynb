    "essentially we create to vectors at the center of the data which are orthognal to each other.This is known as a transformation. Given two vectors $\\vec{y}$ and $\\vec{x}$ we must ensure that at some new point $P$ these vectors our orthognal $\\vec{y} \\perp \\vec{x}$\n",

    "question: given the features of a house, what is its price? this is a classic regression exercise so it's a conyinous which is a number as an output. \n",
    "\n",
    "** Measurable ** \n",
    " - square footage \n",
    " - no. of rooms \n",
    " - school ranking \n",
    " - neighborhood safety \n",

    "we arre proping two things (size, neighborhood) you can't measure directly but are drvigin the phenomenon behind the scene. \n",
    "\n",
    "** Latent ** \n",
    " - size \n",
    " - neighborhood \n",

    "** Variance ** - the willingness / felxibility of an algorithm to learn (Machine Learning) \n",

    "The longer line is goign to be the direction of maximum variance. ** Principal Component** of the data set is the direction that has thed ** Largest Variance ** because it retains maximum amount of \"information\" in the orginal data.\n",

    "\n",
    "<img src= \"p_images/example_4.png\" alt= \"PCA\" style = \"widht: 500px;\"/> \n",
    "essentially, we want to creat a vector where the distance of the projection onto direction of maximal variance minimizes the distance from old (higher-dimensional) data point to its new transformed value. This in turn minimizes information loss. \n",
