### Map Area 

Sacramento, CA, United States 
* https://www.openstreetmap.org/way/33135846
* https://mapzen.com/data/metro-extracts/

Sacramento is where I spend most of my time, so I'm very interested to see what queries I may find regarding my city. 


## Problems Encountered in the Map 

Finding problems within the data and correcting them seemed like a streneous task. I created a sample ``.osm`` file and was able to find certain problems contained within the data that I could correct. However, I went ahead and skipped certain areas that needed correcting. 

* Overabbreviated street names ("_2108 Riverside Blvd._") 
* Inconsistent postal codes ("_95819-6055_","_CA 95834_")
* Incorrect postal codes "_85834_". Some of these were outside the county region like "_Charmichale,CA_". 
* "_Zip Left_" and "_Zip Right_" postal codes that wee included into the ``'k'`` tags for the ``Tiger`` GPS data. This data was devided into segmants
