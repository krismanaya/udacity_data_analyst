# The Simpsons

The data was collected through the Kaggle website and consist information of twenty-one seasons of the simpsons.

## Summary 

the features that are explored within the data are the orginal air data, us viewers in millions, imdb rating, title and seasons. 
withitn each bubble a toolbox appears which gives the read the necessary information of the show that includes the features outlined above. 

## Design 

I wanted the viewer to be be whisked away into the land of the simpsons so I created colorized representations of the simpsons world. While the yellow is not a true representation of the simpsons skin color, it does however make it more palatable to the eyes. The visualized represention gives it a fun view of the simpsons world we known and love. 

## Feedback 

the feedback I was given was to center the logo and change it to black (the original log was white and top left). Secondly, the bubble size was measured along the z-axis in terms of us viwers by millions, however, this created to many large bubbles and was displeasing to the eyes. Third, I was asked to change the coloring within the tool-box so it creates a tone that is more equal to the backround color. Finally, within my first representation I choose to do a box plot however, the bubble plot within show a greater interactive approach with each episode. 

## Resources 

I used the dimple.js resource in github as well as various stack overflow questions. I pulled the simpsons image from font meme. 


## Conclusion 

My final observation would be that clearly you can see the golden age of the simpsons was during 1990 to 1998. This is mainly when Conan O' Brian was a producer for the show and the best writing was done. As time progresses we can see there is less viewers in million, this might be do to the fact that it is possible they have lost viewers, but as you can see within the 2008 - 2016 mark viewer ship starts to decrease drasticly, this coupld possible be do to the age of steaming conent from the internet or various torrent sites, I will never know.
