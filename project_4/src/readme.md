## Explore and Summarize Data

This project is connected to the Data Analysis with R course. Primarily, it is the focus 
of analyzing the 2016 presidental election campaign contributions with canidate Bernie Sanders 
in my home state of California. I want to see average campaign contributions prices as well and 
county regions that donated more. Certain areas of California are primarly more conservative while 
other areas are more liberal. I want to see if contributions are greater or higher within these areas.
